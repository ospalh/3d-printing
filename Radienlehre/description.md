A quick remix of Grant Stevens ingenious [radius gauge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:910616).

I
* dropped the “″”¹. My pet peeve. Americans can’t start using [real units](http://metric4us.com/) soon enough.
* Added the unit, cm. A gauge without units is pretty much useless.
* Used a nicer font, Praxis. When you tweak the values, make sure to set the font to one you actually have.
* Reduced the text extrusion hight.
* Added a preview/render switch and used another method to define the smoothness of curves. Set `preview = false` before you create your own STL file.

For my personal version, i also used filament change to get the black text. And a too light version of the font. Changed it in the STL file to heavy.

¹
»“«, »″«, »”« are three different characters. None of them »"«
