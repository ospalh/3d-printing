Spülbeckenstöpselkettenbefestigungsring
kitchen sink plug chain retainer ring

A small part to fix the ring at the end of some types of kitchen sink chain to the screw of the kitchen sink.

When i recently bought a replacement kitchen sink plug, it came with a chain, but only with a ring like a key ring at the end, and no way to fix that ring to the screw in the kitchen sink. A problem easily solved via 3D printing.

Print settings:
Falsework: yes
When you don’t have a filament cooling fan, you should not print this alone. Put a second thing that is at least 11.1 mm high on the platter along with it to give it time to cool. If you can’t think of anything else to print just print two of this.


There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Stöpselkettenring).
