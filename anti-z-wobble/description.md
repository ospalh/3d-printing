Yet another anti z wobble part.
I use it on my GeeeTech i3, but it should fit on other printers with an M8 lead screw and as 8 mm ⌀ guide rod, like, i think, the Anet A8.

This one is reasonable flat, so you should not have to move up your printing platform, as i had with some of the other designs i tried. With this, the force of the x axis assembly completely rests on the M8 nut. The smooth rod arms are used only for the torque on the nut. They act only as a wrench, not transferring vertical forces and are flat enough to fit under the sliding bearings on the rod.

You’ll need a pair of standard¹ M8 hex nuts.

The picture with the red parts are a before and after comparison. It’s philbarrenger’s [monster mouth headphone holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1657541), which i reprinted to get rid of the “nail file” ridges, once i had found out what the problem was.

Print settings:
200 µm, whatever.

Post-printing:

Sand the top of the main part and the plastic washers, so they x axis connector can slide to and fro on this, which is the whole point. Press in the nuts. Install. Make sure x axis is horizontal. Re-adjust z end-stop. Re-level the bed. Use

how designed:

The washer is a simple OpenSCAD part. The main part was designed in FreeCAD. I added both files. The FreeCAD file contains a spreadsheet, where the sizes can be changed somewhat easily.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/anti-z-wobble). For this it is a bit more interesting then for my other parts, as i tried a few designs before settling on this one.
