My re-imagining (or reverse engineering) of [Anenome](https://www.thingiverse.com/Anenome/about)â€™s [ultramodern soap dish](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1394419).

This skips the filleting of the version 1.6 there, but it does add a true dish, that is, the centre is depressed a bit.


I also added two different feet. Print out four of the style you like and stick them into the underside of the soap dish. I first tried the pointed feet, but found the whole affair  too slippery on my ceramic washbasin.

How

This is done is OpenSCAD, and the, rather simple, source files are included.
