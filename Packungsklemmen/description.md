Clips to hold down the plastic foil lid on those plastic trays cold cuts (»Aufschnitt«) and sliced cheese are sold in (at least in Germany). They should also work great on quark pots. when you can get that stuff.

I usually use three of these for the three edges i peel the lid off of.

There are a few different thicknesses for differently sizes packs. I just write the sizes on the clips after printing.

The round clips are intended for yoghurt and cream (»Sahne«) pots and the like. I don’t use them that often and don’t know if they are the right width. Write a comment if you need them thicker or thinner.

I found that the straight clips are easier to handle than the corner clips i designed first, but i’ll include those anyway.

Print settings

No falsework required. Instead of a raft, you may try a brim.
I used PETG for most of my prints, but they work OK when done in PLA as well.
There are two ways to print the straight clips, as they are, with the spine on the plate, or with the spine upright and the profile on the plate.

How designed

These were inspired by, but are not based on, muzz64’s [pot/tub clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:615341).
I included the FreeCAD files. They include a spreadsheet where you can change most sizes.


There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/NN). I also made a 180° version of the round clips, but i found them even less useful than the corner clips, so i didn’t upload theme here. You can still get them from gihtub.
