A trussed y axis belt holder to fix the print bed to the belt on GeeTech i3 pro C and similar printers.

This replaces the odd aluminium block where you had to punch holes into your belt, that then start to tear the belt apart.

With the gap between the belt ends this works with the original belt that was used with the old block.


In addition to the M3 screws and washers that hold the original block in place you need two square M3 nuts. But you get back the two screws that fixed the belts to the old block.

This should be easy to adapt for other printers where the belt holder is attached with two screws. Just put your printerâ€™s measure into the `scad` file and render it.
