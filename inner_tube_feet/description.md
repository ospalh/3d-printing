A set of sound dampening feet to put your printer on a half inflated bicycle tyre inner tube.

I use this set on my GeeTech i3 printer. It should fit pretty much any type of printer made with 8 mm plates, and other things as well, come to think of it.

I use four double wide (16 mm, 2 × ⟍, 2 × ⟋)  for the double front and end plates, and four single wide (8 mm) for the plates at 90° angle in the middle of the frame, 2 × ⟍, 2 × ⟋ again. The inner tube is making one big loop around the build platform below the printer, with the excess of its length dropping off the table at the back and crossing all the plates at 45°. Put a bicyle inner tube under it and inflate it untill the whole printer is lifted up a bit and floats on the air in the inner tube

I desigend this with the thingiverse customizer in mind. It turns out that that can’t handle a single non-ASCII character, like it’s the 1970s or something. As i like the “⟍” and “⟋” characters i use to indicate the different shapes, the solution if the meshes don’t fit your need is to get [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html). The development snapshot has a build in customizer. Set your sizes there and create the four shapes.

A bit of sanding is advisable, as unrounded corners of this can catch on the tube and tear it during installation.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/inner_tube_feet).
