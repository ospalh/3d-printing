A sound dampening foot to put your printer on a half inflated bicycle tyre inner tube.

This is one of my earlier designs and i used it for my now defunct Replicator style box printer. The mesh is for 5 mm plywood frames. Print a set of four, put one under each corner, an inner tube under that and inflate it until the printer is lifted off the ground and floats on an air cushion.

A bit of sanding is advisable, as unrounded corners of this can catch on the tube and tear it during installation.

This design started out as Gary Crowell Sr.’s [Replicator Isolator Feet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42124), i added the cylindrical inner tube space

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/inner_tube_feet).
