A thing to put on the ends of I-beams, so things you lean or hang on them won’t get scratched by the metal edges.

The neighbour kids very neatly put their bikes on I-beams supports of the court yard’s barrier, out of the way for everybody else. I noticed (too late) that this scratches up the bikes’ paintwork, and came up with this solution.

This is, as somewhat customary for me, a little parametric. Change the lengths in the FreeCAD file’s “sizes” spreadsheet, turn into an mesh and export for a differently sized version.

There is also some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Kantenschutz).
