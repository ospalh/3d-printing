I liked wstein’s
[Customizable Measuring Cup/Scoop](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:619626), but, as i (still) have no filament fan, i have a problem with 45° overhangs. So i put the scoop upright again. Print this with falsework.

Elsewhere i complained about the use of a ton of units, and i still try to get everyone to use practical units. Americans should look up the millilitres per teaspoon &c. in [this list](http://www.jsward.co m/cooking/conversion.shtml), and visit [metric4us](http://metric4us.com/) at their leisure after they printed their portioner.
As a reminder to everybody, millilitre and ml are just synonyms for cubic centimetre and cm³.

## how designed

I just stlightly tweaked this from  wstein’s original. See the “remixed from” thing for details.

The size may be off a little bit more than the original. This is not a precision tool, just a rough measure.

There is a little bit of history of my changes available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Messschaufel).

## Food and 3D printing

Take care when you use 3D printed parts with food.

* PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that. Or maybe PETG
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.

## Vocabulary rant

***[falsework](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsework)***: a temporary frame serving to support and brace a building under construction until it can stand alone.

In other word, those structures that you sometimes need when printing overhangs.My guess is that the first people that wrote a slicer just didn’t know that word, maybe even the large scale construction *concept*, and reinvented the wheel and named it the “circular transportation facilitation device”. Or “supports”. I try my best to use the correct word, falsework, when possible.
