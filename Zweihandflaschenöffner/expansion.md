I uploaded this with a shorter description, here a tiny bit more, as an iFAQ (imaginary FAQ).

Q: Is this a joke?
A: Yes. The question is, what kind of joke.

Q: I knew it wasnâ€™t a bottle opener.
A: Thatâ€™s not a question.

Q: So this is not a bottle opener?
A: No, it is. I use it to open bottles all the time.

Q: How?
A: GIYF ðŸ˜› One hint: you do have to use two hands, not just one hand and a stand. If you need a one-handed bottle opener, buy a grab opener.


Q: Canâ€™t i just use a folded meterstick or a cigarette lighter?
A: Yes.
