## Vocabulary rant

***[falsework](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsework)***: a temporary frame serving to support and brace a building under construction until it can stand alone.

In other word, those structures that you sometimes need when printing overhangs.My guess is that the first people that wrote a slicer just didn’t know that word, maybe even the large scale construction *concept*, and reinvented the wheel and named it the “circular transportation facilitation device”. Or “supports”. I try my best to use the correct word, falsework, when possible.
