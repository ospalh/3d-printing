Yet anonther door hook/hanger.

This one is sized for rabbeted doors, and thus somewhat smaller on top. Also, i like the rounding of the thing, which many of the others don’t have.

This should fit onto a door with a 15 mm thick and 14 mm deep rabbet. These sizes can be changed in the spreadsheet of the included FreeCAD file. Change the two values for »Falz«, the German word for rabbet.

## print

falsework: no
raft: maybe


For some reason thingiverse shows `.OBJ` mesh files rotated 90°, but once loaded into the slicer it should be lying flat.

Because of the rounding the contact area isn’t all that big, so a brim or raft may be useful.

## design

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Türhaken).
