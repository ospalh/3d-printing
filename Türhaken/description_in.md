Yet anonther door hook/hanger.

This one is sized for rabbeted doors, and thus somewhat smaller on top. Also, i like the rounding of the thing, which many of the others don’t have.

This should fit onto a door with a 15 mm thick and 14 mm deep rabbet. These sizes can be changed in the spreadsheet of the included FreeCAD file. Change the two values for »Falz«, the German word for rabbet.
