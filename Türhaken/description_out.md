Yet anonther door hook/hanger. This one is a bit different from the other ones, as it fits onto rabbeted doors to hang stuff on the hallway side.

As the top has to fit into rabbet joint, it is somewhat thinner than others, and not as strong. Maybe don’t hang your heavy winter coat or full backpack onto this.

This should fit onto a door with a 15 mm thick and 14 mm deep rabbet and X mm thick doors. These sizes can be changed in the spreadsheet of the included FreeCAD file. Change the two values for »Falz«, the German word for rabbet, and the one for gesamtdicke.
