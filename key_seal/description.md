key seal

A thing to seal a key in. Use this for emergency or spare keys.

You can use this to hand your apartment key to neighbours that you trust, but not *that* much. How to explain the trust issue or how to deal with it when they hand back the key with the seal open are things you have to work out on your own.

Set the sizes in the customizer.

### How to print

You need to pause the print just before the first of the two grid layers and put in the key. The design contains some clearance, but you must make sure that the key does not protrude from the form when you put it in.

Otherwise it’s an easy print. I use a brim for this, like for most of my prints, but it should work fine without.

Falsework (“supports”) must be switched *off* in the slicer. The space for the key is the whole point of this. The grid layers help stabilizing this anyway.

### how designed

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/key_seal).


## Vocabulary rant

***[falsework](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsework)***: a temporary frame serving to support and brace a building under construction until it can stand alone.

In other word, those structures that you sometimes need when printing overhangs.My guess is that the first people that wrote a slicer just didn’t know that word, maybe even the large scale construction *concept*, and reinvented the wheel and named it the “circular transportation facilitation device”. Or “supports”. I try my best to use the correct word, falsework, when possible.
