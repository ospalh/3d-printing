key seal

A thing to seal a key in. Use this for emergency or spare keys.

You can use this to hand your apartment key to neighbours that you trust, but not *that* much. How to explain the trust issue or how to deal with it when they hand back the key with the seal open are things you have to work out on your own.

Set the sizes in the customizer.
### How to print

You need to pause the print just before the first of the two grid layers and put in the key. The design contains some clearance, but you must make sure that the key does not protrude from the form when you put it in.

Otherwise itâ€™s an easy print. I use a brim for this, like for most of my prints, but it should work fine without.

### how designed

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/key_seal).
