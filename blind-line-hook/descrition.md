A one-off replacement part.

clamp/hook/bracket

The build-in locking mechanism of my Ikea window blinds broke. So i needed something to fix the drawstring and to stop the blinds from falling down again once pulled up.

It turns out that the window sill is at exactly the right height. If only i could somehow hook the knob on the drawstring to the windowsill â€¦

I put it on the *under*side of the sill with double sided tape, on top of the flat part, and on the adjacent side of the hook bit.

When i open the blinds, i just slide the knob into this thing. Done.

You can tweak the values in the .scad file if you need just slightly different dimensions.
