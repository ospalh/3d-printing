Bicycle helmet (Bell Ukon) coat rack hook

A hook to hang an Bell Ukon or similar  bike helmet on a coat rack.
This is designed for coat racks with mushroom shaped pegs. You slide the hook on the peg and leave it there. Then you hang your helmet on the hook when you come home.

With this hook you hang up your bike helmet with the top towards the wall, you put it on the wall in one motion by just doffing your helmet.
The hook is designed with the Bell Ukon helmet in mind, but should work with others that have a similarly shaped hole at the crown. See the red marks in the image. The wall side hole is sized for a peg with diameters of 8.3 mm and 16.1 mm and a thin stem of 16.8 mm. The FreeCAD file contains a spreadsheet where these sizes can be changed. Afterwards, check that the shape is still valid, convert it to a mesh and export that.

This should print easily in PLA. No rafts or falsework needed. A brim may be useful to avoid warping.

There is a bit of design history in the [Helmhaken](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Helmhaken) folder of my github 3d printing repo.
