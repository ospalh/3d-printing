Description
Who’d have thought that there was a character, and not even an emoji, for this thing.

Anyway, i wanted a simple way to heat small amounts of (oat) milk to froth for the not-quite cappuccino i like to drink. Put what you want heated into a small pot, fill this bain-marie with hot water to the upper end of the top centering lugs, put the small pot in, et voilà.

This is parametric. The important bits are the diameter, the depth, and the width of the water.

Of course this will not heat anything up to anything close 373 K, with no heating element anywhere near, but it’s good enough for what i want it for.

## How to print

Easy print

Use a heat resistant material. ABS works well, PLA does not.

## Post-printing

I painted mine with a simple, clear varnish intended for wood to get it water tight.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/NN).

I use “Simplified Spelling Boaad”/“Handbook of Simplified Spelling” rules.
