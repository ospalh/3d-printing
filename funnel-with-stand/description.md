## Customizable funnel with or without stand

A funnel where the main parameters can be changed. You either get a special stand with it or not.

Stick a sharpened pencil into the stand and the funnel on top of this pencil. Then you can place your receptacle under the funnel. This is intended for light use. A few tea leaves rather than kilogrammes of sugar.

I wanted a funnel with a rather low throat ratio, if that is the
term,to fill paper tea filters. The tea leaves always jam in the necks
of supermarket funnels.

### Customizer

Not all slider value combinations in the customizer produce reasonable results. Especially a too high tip angle may cut off parts of the funnel proper. Just use different values when you get odd shapes.

The included STL files are smoother than what you get out of the
customizer. You can download the SCAD file, open it in OpenSCAD and
uncomment the `$fs` and `$fa` lines according to the comment to get
this smoothness.

### Print Settings

* I used a 300 Âµm layer height, because this thing is more about utility than aesthetics, but use whatever you like
* No supports
* No raft or brim
* Standard low infill. About 20 % should be enough.

### Food safety concerns

* When you want to funnel foodstuffs, you should probably use PLA, food grade PLA when you are concerned.
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.
* The funnelled material comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, so it should not be effected by the plastic too much. Especially when you use dry stuff.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.
