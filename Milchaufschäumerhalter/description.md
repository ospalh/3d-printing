A stand for my milk frother. This fits the Severin model i have. Use two standard pencils as supports. The hight of the holder can be reduced with a pencil sharpener.

Use the customizer to change it until it fits your model. Important are the top and bottom diameters and the hight. If it wobbles around, check where it doesn’t fit and change the corresponding size.

## how print

This has some smallish bridges at the top of the upper pencil connectors, but they should work quite well without supports. So, over all this is an easy print. For the upper part yu need a bit of bed adhesion. Use standard methods (raft, brim) if this is a problem.

## how designt

The pencil connectors and the basic shape of the base i took from my [funnel]()’s stand, going from one or three supports to two.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Milchaufschäumerhalter).
