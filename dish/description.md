A simple parametric dish. I use small ones for small parts such as screws when servicing my printer. Just change what you need in the customizer. Or download it and change a few things more, like the wall thickness.

Easy print

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/dish).
