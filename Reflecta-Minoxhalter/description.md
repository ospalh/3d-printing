A film strip holder to scan Minox “spy camera” film with a [Reflecta ProScan 10T](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html), cheap-compared-to-drum-scanner film scanner i own. I think the predecessor, the ProScan 7200 uses the same holders.

This uses a bunch of tiny 1 mm high × 2 mm ⌀ neodynium magnets to hold shut. If you have other sizen lying around.

##How to print

Print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to. It is designed with a 0.4 mm nozzle in mind.

You do need to pause the print to put in the magnets.
N.B.: make sure you put them in in the right direction. I used a pen to mark the same pole on all of them, the top side when they formed a stack, and then put them in with the mark up for the top half and down for the bottom half of the holder.


## Post-printing

This needs a bit of deburring. You also have to carefully break free the hinges. I also sanded mine all over to give it a matte finish.

## How designed

First i looked at shred’s [110 film holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1328672) for plustek scanners. Firt change the outer size to “Reflecta”, scan my stack of 110 films, than change the film size and scan the Minox. Turns out i only had one 110 film, which i scanned on my flatbed scanner.

So i started over from scratch. This should be somewhat easy to convert to 110 size, but you have to do that yourself if you are interested.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Reflecta-Minoxhalter). I briefly experimented with a hinge (based on rohinosling’s  [parametric hinge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2187167)) but i had too much problems breaking them free.
