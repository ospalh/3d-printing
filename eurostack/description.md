Stacking and storage aid for euro coins.

This allows you to stack and store a set of euro coins, one for each value, e.g. eight coins from one country, year and mint. I use it to reduce the storage volue of a coin collection i inherited. I don’t want to sell it, but don’t want it to waste too much space in my cupboard, either.

They are stacked by diameter, not value:
* 1 ¢
* 2 ¢
* 10 ¢
* 5 ¢
* 20 ¢
* 1 €
* 50 ¢
* 2 €

With the lid, you can put a bit Tesa or other stick tape around it without problem.

The differet `STL` files are done with different amounts of clearance, in millimtres.

This is a straightforward OpenSCAD design. Just a few cylinders. This uses somewhat thin walls, because it is not intended to carry significant loads, just to keep the coins in place. It should be reasonably straightforward to adapt this to other currencies.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/eurostack).
