[Once upon a time](https://taz.de/Freispruch-fuer-Monchi/!5468333/) there was a bunch of neonazis that tried to toss chairs at migrants. They were stopped by antifascists, who must have shouted “Alerta! Alerta! Antifascista!” as they arrivt. Then the antifa were accused of tossing those chairs. One policeman said this as a witness: “And then they chanted their slogan” What slogan? “I don’t speak Spanish. ‘[Barista, barista, antifascista!](https://taz.de/Missverstandene-Antifa-Schlachtrufe/!5472705/)’, something like that”.

So this is how “Barista, barista, antifascisata!” became the tung-in-cheeck slogan of German antifa.

This is my recreation of the logo as a printable badge.

Ich hatte vor einiger Zeit Versionen dieses Logos gesehen, kannte aber die Entstehungsgeschichte nicht. Selbst wenn, der Überlapp aus Kaffeetrinker•innen und Antifaschist•innen klingt nach einem angenehmen Völkchen. Hier das [Logo](https://taz.de/Missverstandene-Antifa-Schlachtrufe/!5472705/) zum [Freispruch](https://taz.de/Freispruch-fuer-Monchi/!5468333/).

### how

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/barista_antifascista_badges).

The text i did in inkscape (The ways to do curvt text in OpenSCAD are bad hacks that require monospaced fonts). Arrange the text along the curves (circles in this case), do object-to-path, remove the circles.
Then save the paths as OpenSCAD files using an [export extension](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2805184).


The moka pot is based on a [wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moka_Pot.jpeg) image. Thanks, Xenon 77. I cut it out in Gimp, copied, filled red and black and arrangd the two pots, with a gap done through a third layer. I traced this picture in inkview and  savt this with the OpenSCAD export.
