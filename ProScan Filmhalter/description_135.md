Reflecta ProScan Minox film holder

A film strip holder to scan four image 135 (standard 35 mm) film with a [Reflecta ProScan](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own. This should fit both the 10T and 7200 models.

I already have two original [Reflecta holders](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.740/Filmholder-ProScan-10T--ProScan-7200.html) for this, so i didn’t print this. This was just a logical step in adapting my Minox holder to 126 Instamatic films, and i thought i might share it as well.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut.

You can use the customizer to change the size to adapt to your film scanner.

This is a simle derivative of the [ProScan Minox film holder](). Check the description there.

Put in the film with the shinier carrier side up and the matte emulsion down.


##How to print

Use black to reduce stray light. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing

This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.

See the [ProScan Minox film holder]() for exhaustive magnet gluing tips.

## How designed

This is derived from my [ProScan Minox film holder]().

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
