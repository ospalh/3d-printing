Reflecta ProScan Minox film holder

A film strip holder to scan four image 126 “large” Instamatic film strips with a [Reflecta ProScan](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own.  This should fit both the 10T and 7200 models.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut.

You can use the customizer to change the size to adapt to your film scanner.

This is a simle derivative of the [ProScan Minox film holder](). Check the description there.

Make sure the tiny posts go through the film perforations and check that the frames of the strip line up with the windows of the holder. The shiny carrier side of the strip must be up.


##How to print

Use black to reduce stray light. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing

This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.

See the [ProScan Minox film holder]() for exhaustive magnet gluing tips.

## How designed

This is derived from my [ProScan Minox film holder]().

The exact sizes are based on measurments of a film strip, but it worked well enough. I did scan one strip on a flatbed scanner. Even without a transparency unit you see enough to measure the several lengths. You just have to convert from pixel to usable units. At 600 dpi one pixel is 25.4/600 mm = 0.0423̄ mm long. Multiply the pixel count you get in Gimp by that value, an you have the length you need.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
