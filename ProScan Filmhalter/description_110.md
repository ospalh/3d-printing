Reflecta ProScan Minox film holder

A film strip holder to scan 110 (Pocket Instamatic) film with a [Reflecta ProScan 10T](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own. I think the predecessor, the ProScan 7200 uses the same holders.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut.

You can use the customizer to change the size to adapt to your film scanner.

This is a close relative of the [ProScan Minox film holder](). Check the description there.

##How to print

Use black to reduce stray light. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing

This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.

See the [ProScan Minox film holder]() for exhaustive magnet glueing tips.

## How designed

As said above this is derived from my [ProScan Minox film holder](). I first thought i had only one 110 film and didn’t want to do one for that size, but later discovered a few more that i really wanted to scan with high resolution. Thus, this size.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
