Reflecta ProScan 110 film holder

A film strip holder to scan six image 110 “Pocket” Instamatic film strips with a [Reflecta ProScan](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own.  This should fit both the 10T and 7200 models. *Most* of the strips i have are five images long, but some have six.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut.

You can use the customizer to change the size to adapt to your film scanner.

This is derived from the [ProScan Minox film holder](). Check the description there.

Make sure the tiny posts go through the film perforations and that the shiny carrier side of the strip is up.


##How to print

* 200 µm
* 20% infill

I used black to reduce stray light at first. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing


This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.

On the one i printed in blue instead of black i painted the slanted window frame black to reduce coloured stray light.

See the [ProScan Minox film holder]() for exhaustive magnet gluing tips.

## How designed

This is derived from my [ProScan Minox film holder]().

The exact sizes are based on measurments of a film strip. I could have paid 118 Swiss francs and looked up the values in the standard, but this should be good enough.

After i scanned my films and took the pictures, i changed this from five to six, and removed the last positioning post for the last image, because there is no perforation on the last strip.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
