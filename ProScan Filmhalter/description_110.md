Reflecta ProScan 110 film holder

A film strip holder to scan six image 110 “Pocket” Instamatic film strips with a [Reflecta ProScan](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own.  This should fit both the 10T and 7200 models. *Most* of the strips i have are five images long, but some have six.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut.

You can use the customizer to change the size to adapt to your film scanner.

This is derived from the [ProScan Minox film holder](). Check the description there.

Make sure the tiny posts go through the film perforations and that the shiny carrier side of the strip is up.


##How to print

Use black to reduce stray light. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing

This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.

See the [ProScan Minox film holder]() for exhaustive magnet gluing tips.

## How designed

This is derived from my [ProScan Minox film holder]().

The exact sizes are based on measurments of a film strip. I could have paid 118 Swiss francs and looked up the values in the standard, but this should be good enough.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
