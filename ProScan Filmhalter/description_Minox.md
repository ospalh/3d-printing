Reflecta ProScan Minox film holder

A film strip holder to scan [Minox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minox) spy camera¹ 9.2 mm film with a [Reflecta ProScan](https://reflecta.de/en/products/detail/~id.734~nm.69/reflecta-ProScan-10T.html) cheap-compared-to-drum-scanners film scanner i own.  This should fit both the 10T and 7200 models.

This uses eight tiny 1 mm high × 2.4 mm ⌀ neodymium magnets to hold shut. They are not strictly necessary.

You can use the customizer to change the overall size, and the size of the magnets. With a bit of luck it will then work with other film scanners. Make sure to subtract a bit of clearance from the measured size of your original holder. When you need a mallet to go from one picture to the next the thing is too big.

There are versions for other film sizes that i plan to publish soon.

Put in the film with the shinier carrier side up and the matte emulsion down.


The black-and-white pictures was scanned with this thing, and is the only one in the collection that DIA or GRU might have been interested in.

##How to print

I used black to reduce stray light, but other dark colours should be fine. PLA is fine, print settings aren’t too important. No falsework required. Warping might be a problem, so use a brim or raft if you have to.


## Post-printing

This needs quite a bit of deburring and sanding. Also, a bit of filing before you can scan your negatives and file them again.


### Gluing in the magnets

Gluing in the magnets was surprisingly tricky. They tend to fly through the air towards any piece of iron and to flip over all the time. I came up with this procedure.

#### Tools

* The eight magnets
* The holder and clamp
* Magnetic surface to store stacks of magnets. A “copper” (iron) coin like 1, 2 or 5 eurocent works fine
* Eight M3 or smaller bolts or similar iron rods
* Eight small (c. 1 cm × 5 cm) pieces of paper
* Pens, to mark metal surfaces and paper
* Toothpick or similar non-magnetic implement
* Super glue
* Latex or similar gloves
* Other protective materials. Newspaper for the table, face shield &c.

#### Procedure

* Make a stack out of the magnets on the coin
* Mark the top side of each magnet with a pen and form a second stack of marked magnets. This is to mark the same pole on all the magnets.
* Mark one side of all the pieces of paper
* Take one magnet and place it on the table alone
* Take a piece of paper and place it on top of the magnet, with the marked side up or down to match the magnet
* Take a bolt and put it on the magnet, clamping the paper
* Do this for the other seven magnets, too.
* Make sure the bolt-magnets don’t get too close to each other
* Make sure four have the mark up and four the mark down, both on the magnet and on the paper
* Don the gloves, open a window
* Take the holder and the four magnets with the mark up
* Festina lente
* For each, put a bit of glue into the magnet depression
* Re-seal the glue container
* Take the bolt with the magnet and put the magnet into the hole
* Hold down the paper and remove the bolt
* Remove the paper
* Push the magnet into place with the toothpick, if necessary
* Repeat for the clamp and the magnets facing the other way


## How designed

First i looked at shred’s [110 film holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1328672) for plustek scanners: Change the outer size to “Reflecta”, scan my stack of 110 films, than change the film size and scan the Minox. But i decided to start over from scratch, anyway.

I briefly experimented with a hinge (based on rohinosling’s  [parametric hinge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2187167)) but i had too much problems breaking them free. (The original Reflecta film holders do have a hinge.)

For a while i had planned to bury the magnets. Pause the print, put them in, let them be covered by PLA. The putting in worked OK, but i later found them on the steel extruder carrier. They had leaped up when a big iron mass passed by, foiling this plan.

There was also a version with thin bars to separate the images, but as the spacing of them on the Minox films i have is so irregular i dropped that. The 110 and 126 versions do have such bars.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/ProScan Filmhalter).
