A simplified version of the [Customizable Bike Mount for Smartphone](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3066652). (You need a [Customizable Smartphone Tripod Holder (…)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2771040), too.)

The original had two main variants, a complete ring around the handlbar fixt with screws and a zip tie version. That *also* used a whole ring around the handlbar. I thought that was odd. My bike speedometer’s mounting is just the plate and an O-ring to keep it in place. So, this is a small version of the zip tie mount. Just the plate and grooves for the zip ties.

There are versions for a few different tube sizes ready. 33 mm is the size of my handlbar stem. With this stile, the exact size of the handlbar isn’t too important. If you want your exact size, anyway, or if you want to use zip ties wider than 3 mm, use the customizer. Set the sizes, switch from “Preview” to “Render” and *then* click “Create Thing”.



### Print settings

no supports

For the four arm holder, something a bit more flexible, like PETG, may be advisable, but this should work fine in PLA.

### post printing

To mount your fone, you need this, a [Smartphone Tripod Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2771040), two long enough 3 mm zip ties, four 10 mm M3 screws and four M3 hex nuts.

I like to glue in my nuts, but you can just stick them in without that.

### how

This is derived from [Customizable Bike Mount for Smartphone](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3066652), with some of my standard tweaks.
There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/NN).

¹For the nominally 25.4 mm handlbars. Don’t get me started on units of measurement.
