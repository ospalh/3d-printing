A pair of brackets to mount the display of a GeeTech i3 printer at the front, like a original Prusa i3s.

Apart from the improved stability when using the input knob, this also removes the screws from the top of the frame, and cable chains should work smoother, especially for high prints.


This requires two M10 nuts, and you should use some washers. If it’s too far to the hardware store, or too late in the evening, you can try a nut from this [screw library](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796). I’m not sure, but you may need slightly longer M3 screws¹ than those used for the top mounting, so you may have to go to the hardware store after all. Or rummage through the screws left from building the thing up in the first place.

In the pictures the printer is resting on my [inner tube feet]().

# Post-printing

To install, mark² and remove the cables, unscrew the display, replace the connector and the 5 mm spacers with the 10 mm spacers from this thing, and screw it to the holder. The short arms must be up and the large holes on the outside. Don’t tighten the screws at this time. Then reroute and reconnect the cables, put the assembly onto the M10 main rods and tighten everything up with the M10 and M3 nuts.


# how

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Displayhalter). I actually printed mine without the cut for the SD card holder and ground off the space rather than reprint the thing.

¹ I did look up the difference between “bolt” and “screw” and decided that for me a bolt is a species of screw and will use “screw” for bolts when i feel like it. This may be from my native German, where those are all »Schrauben«.
²For example with one dot for one cable-connector pair and two dots for the other one.
