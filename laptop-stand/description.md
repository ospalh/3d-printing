Flat laptop stand

Sometimes i like to place a laptop on the ground, with the screen almost flush with it, so that i can look at it from above. So here is a laptop stand for that. The screen ends up in a 30° angle from the *horizontal*.

There are two variants, one for thin laptops where the hinge is arranged so there is no step when it’s open, and those that have a step there.

Print setting:

Mirror the provided STL in your slice so that you get a pair.
I generally like to print with low infil and many perimeters and top layers, but set it up to your taste. 300 µm layer hight should be fine.

A brim may be useful to avoid warping

Post printing:

You need two standard sized pencils. Tear off any erasers, and saw of the the tips, when they came sharpened.


How desigend:


This is slightly parametric. With a bit of work you can adapt this to your laptop, and your print bed. For that i have included the FreeCAD files. They include a spreadsheet called “sizes”. Change values there, check the shape still works, turn it into a mesh and export it.

There is also some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/laptopstand).
