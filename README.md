## 3d printing

This is collection of FreeCAD and OpenSCAD files, scripts, and other files for 3d printing designs i came up with or found and remixed.

Several have been published on [thingiverse](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/y-belt-holder), a few on [YouMagine](https://www.youmagine.com/ospalh/designs).

Some of the more intresting ones:

### yacs

*Y*et *A*nother *C*oin *S*pinner.
Yeah, it’s a collection of fidget spinners. These use coins and you can set up *which* coin by changing values in a spreadsheet in the FreeCAD files.

### Tea portioner

A gadget to portion my roibos tea leaves and pour it into
the filter holder.

### Funnel with stand

A parametric funnel. I use it to hold the paper tea filter when i poor in the roibos out of the tea portioner.

### Bottle tray

Rings to hold bottles close together and upright in your fridge and elsewhere.

### Hyperboloid dice tower

A very light dice tower that looks like the cooling tower of a (nuclear) power station.


### Helmet hook

Two different ways to hang up a bicycle helmet.


Some of the others are just ideas or work in progress.
