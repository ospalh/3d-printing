A fone holder to put on the back side of the back rest of a chair.

Before, i usually laid my phone on the chair, but was afraid i might accidentally sit on it one day. No more.

This fits the chair i have, with a curved back rest with a radius of about 0.5 m and my fone of about 75 mm × 10 mm. When scaling it to your size doesn’t work, the sizes can be changed in the FreeCAD file’s spreadsheet.

Easy. 200 µm – 300 µm

Stick it to the chair with double sided tape.


how designed

To measure the chair’s radius i used my [radius gauge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3248890), based on [Grant Stevens’](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:910616).

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/fone_holder).
