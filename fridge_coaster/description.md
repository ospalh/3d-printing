A simple thing to solve a small problem.

The condiment bottles in my fridge always fell over, with the rounded bottom and the grid shelf. So i designed pot-like coasters with grooves in the bottom that fit the grid of my fridge shelf. The important parameters, grid and bottle size, can be changed in the customizer, or , if it doesnâ€™t work, in OpenSCAD.

Print settings: uncritical

How desingend:

This is just a few cylinders, no fancy rounding or the like.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/fridge_coaster).
