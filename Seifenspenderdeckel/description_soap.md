Yet another lid for Sagrotan/Dettol hands-free hand soap dispenser.

An original 250 cm³ re-fil for this costs € 3.45 in my local supermarket, or € 13.8 / 1 dm³. Store brand liquid soap costs € 0.79 per 750 cm³ pouch, or € 1.05 / 1 dm³. Savings of over an order of margnitude is something a Swabian can’t skip, really.

The lid itself doesn’t need much work. Maybe a bit of sanding to get a nice round top edge.

What i found harder than expected was making a hole in the empty original container. I did it like this:
* Switch off the dispenser and take the container out
* Peel off the old label and clean the container with propan-2-ol or similar
* Take a large coin (€ 2) and draw a circle around it at top centre of the thing
* Use a straight awl and a rubber mallet to punch a ring of holes into it
* Use a side cutter to cut out the plastic between the holes

## How desigend
There are at least three other things [948701](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:948701) [2612891](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2612891) [854592](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:854592) already here, so why another one? Mostly because i didn’t really look before i designed this. But why upload it then? Because i like the rounding and the clip-on effect of mine. Things the other ones don’t have.

This was done in OpenSCAD, and i have added the source file. Ther is also some design history at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/Seifenspenderdeckel)
