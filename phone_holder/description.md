A phone holder to put on the back side of the back rest of a chair.

This fits the chair i have, with a curved back rest with a radius of about 0.5 m. (I used NN’s [radius gauge]() to determine that. That was a great idea.) The relevant parameters can be changed in the FreeCAD file’s spreadsheet.

To secure the cable i use [cable clip NN]().
