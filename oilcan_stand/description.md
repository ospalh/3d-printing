A stand for the oilcan i use to lubricate my priter. The main feature is a little dish to catch drops falling off the oiling tip.

The pictures are of an earlier version without the centering horns.

Iâ€™ve made some parameters customizable to adapt to differently sized oilcans.

How to print:

Easy print

How designed:

This is a simple OpenSCAD design of just a few cylenders, cones and cuboids.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/oilcan_stand).
