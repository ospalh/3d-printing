A hook to hold up the x axis assembly of a GeeTech i3 pro C printer. Use a pair.

An extra benefit of an anti z-wobble part is that it allows you to pull up the whole x axis assembly. I use this to clean the nozzle, change filaments, or just clean the build plate.

Center the x axis. Use both hands. Grab the left and right of the top x axis rod with the round hooks from behind, pull up and hook the square parts over the acrylic frame, to the left and right of the display.

### Caveat
This requires an anti z-wobble part. Without it, when pulling on the rods you’ll lift the whole printer.

### Caveat 2
Remember to let the assembly down again before you start a print. I mention this because this might be something that people might forget. It totally hasn’t happened to me, like, a dozen times. Of course not.
