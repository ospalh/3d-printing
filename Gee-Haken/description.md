A hook to hold up the x axis assembly of a GeeTech i3 pro C printer. Use a pair.


An extra benefit of an anti z-wobble part is that it allows you to pull up the whole x axis assembly. I use this to clean the nozzle, change filaments, or just clean the build plate.

Center the x axis. Use both hands. Grab the left and right of the top x axis rod with the round hooks from behind, pull up and hook the square parts over the acrylic frame, to the left and right of the display.

This might work for other printers with a similar layout, but probably not as well when the distances and sizes aren’t exactly the same.


### Caveat
This requires an anti z-wobble part. Without it, when pulling on the rods you’ll lift the whole printer.

### Caveat 2
Remember to let the assembly down again before you start a print. I mention this because this might be something that people might forget. It totally hasn’t happened to me, like, a dozen times. Of course not.


Print settings:

300 µm
Easy print, no falsework, maybe a brim or raft


how desigend

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Gee-Haken).

I have done this in different lengths. I usually use only the longest, the 120 mm version. The other pair i have printed is the 75 mm version.


I have included the FreeCAD file. The sizes can be changed in the spreadsheet.
