trivet wedge Untersetzerkeil

A wedge to go under the trivet to tilt your soup bowl or tureen to make the soup run into one corner when there’s not much of it left. I’ll spare you a picture of my half eaten soup.

N.B.: Especially when you do it in PLA you should not put a hot pot directly on this thing. Do use a trivet.

The layer height determines how smooth the top is, but the steps of a high layer height give this a bit of an anti slip effect, which is fine.

I did this one in FreeCAD, not OpenSCAD, to learn that program, and to get nicer roundings and bevels. The FreeCAD file is included.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Untersetzerkeil).
