Yet another shower tray to hold your shower gel and shampoo. This one uses separate holders that you stick to the wall with double sided tape. The advantage is that this works with normal walls that aren’t exactly at a 90° angle, not just manufactured shower cabins. There is also a space for the sealant in the corner.

There are two sizes of the holders. In the end i went with the larger ones. When you want a different size you can change it in the OpenSCAD file.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Duschregal).
