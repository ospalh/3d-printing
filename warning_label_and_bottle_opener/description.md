[C Biker](https://www.thingiverse.com/CBiker/about) gave me the idea for the warning label by offering eir own version on eir indispensable [CTC printer tuning](http://www.newmansworld.de/3d-druck/tuning.html) web page. I just think ey missed a thing or two. So here is what i improved:

* Drop the bit about the kapton tape. That is not a safety warning, just a tip to make your life easier
* Use standard warning symbols
* Replace Engrish with concise warnings
* Use black and white for text, drop stripes.
* Added pinch warning

In the PDF you get the warning in English and German. In the ODT file (Open Office/Libre Office), you get a third version where you can replace the Lorem ipsum with your own localized version.

2D print it out and stick it on your 3D printer.

As this is a 3D printing site, i added a 3D object to print. A bottle opener. ..

I guess that needs some explanation, so here is an iFAQ (imaginary FAQ).


Q: Is this a joke?
A: Yes. The question is, what kind of joke.

Q: I knew it wasnâ€™t a bottle opener.
A: Thatâ€™s not a question.

Q: So this is not a bottle opener?
A: No, it is. I use it to open bottles all the time.

Q: How?
A: GIYF ðŸ˜› One hint: you have to use two hands. If you need a one-handed bottle opener, try [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480178) or its parent.
