Scan 9.2 mm Minox “spy camera” film with a standard transparency film scanner.

With this you can scan two 11 image  Minox film strips at once by putting them into the holder and that into the hole for standard 35 mm negative film strips.

Print one holder and two clamps. Or two and four to scan one whole film in one go.

The standard Minox films are cut into 4 strips à 10 exposures, but in the collection i inherited some of the strips are 11 exposures,


This is desigend with quite a bit of clearance between the parts. You can change that in the SCAD file i included, if you have a more precise printer than i.

How to print:

raft: yes
not at 45°
layer: check the number of perimeters
