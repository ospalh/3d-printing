### Food and 3D printing

* In some ways PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that. Or maybe PETG
* On the other hand, aceton smoothed ABS has fewer ridges for germs to reside in, so maybe do that instead
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.
* The food comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, and it is usually dry, so it should hardly be effected at all.
(* When you cook the food after using this it, germs shouldnâ€™t be too much of a problem either. The heat should deal with that.)

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.
