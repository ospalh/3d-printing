Small mushroom anchor

A functional small mushroom anchor.

I use this to anchor a line in a flower pot that climber plants can use to climb up on. For the top i use my upstairs neighbour’s balcony and a printed [clamp](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1859040).

The sizes can be changed in the customizer.

I originally tried this with a more traditional spherical shell. That didn’t work, or rather, didn’t print. You would have to use falsework to make it stick. That version is still available when you browse the history of the repository on [github](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/mushroom_achor), before 24 September 2018.
