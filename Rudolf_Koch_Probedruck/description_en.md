What to do, when you have told all your friends an colleagues that you own a 3D printer, and now they’re all asking you for free samples?

Something like this happened to the German font designer and type artist
[Rudolf Koch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Koch_(Schriftk%C3%BCnstler)). (Link in German) He had a postcard ready that he send as a reply to anyone who asked for a sample of his art.

Theſe are two Engliſh translations of that poﬅcard, a literal and an idiomatic one. The original was a print made oﬀ hand-drawn calligraphy. This is done in a font ſimilar to the original deſign, and of a ﬅyle, “[Schwabacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabacher)”, that Koch was quite fond of.

There are three variants of each translation:
* `Rudolf Koch’s reply, {literal,idiomatic}, unconnected.stl`: A quick print that falls apart when you remove it from the print plate. Sort-of in line with the text.
* `Rudolf Koch’s reply, {literal,idiomatic}, negative.stl`: The text as a negative. You can use filament changes or the nail polish and acetone-trick¹. As thingiverse adds vidios to the top automatically no link. Search youtube for “Finishing 3D prints with nailpolish and acetone”.
* `Rudolf Koch’s reply, {literal,idiomatic}, positive.stl`: For filament change when printing.


There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Rudolf_Kochs_Probedruck).



Safety note:
¹ Aceton isn’t too dangerous, bot not harmless either. Open a window and wear gloves and safety goggles or a face shield. Read a typical [MSDS](http://physics.utsa.edu/memslab/MSDS/Acetone.pdf).
