Yet another coin fidget spinner. This one is a compact three arm version. My personal favourite of the bunch.

The centre hole is for the standard 608 skate bearing, 22 mm × 7 mm.

There are a two ready-made STLs there, for coins i had lying around:

* Nine 20 euro cent coins
* Twelve 5 euro cent coins
* Twelve 1 euro cent coins
* Nine UK 2p coins
* Twelve UK pennies
* Twelve 1 角人民币 (1 Jiao RMB) coins

The 1 euro cent version is somewhat smaller than the other ones, with a thin wall between the bearing and the coins, and a thinner outer wall, compared to the other STLs.

# How designed

This is slightly parametric. Whit a bit of work you can use your favourite coins, either local currencies, or parts of that little pile of foreign currency that travellers tend to collect. For that i have included the FreeCAD files. They include a spreadsheet called “sizes”. To get a new spinner, do this:

* Download [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Download) and get it running
* Load the `yaccs_3_arm.fcstd` FreeCAD file
* In the tree view, double click on “Sizes”. You should see the spreadsheet
* Measure your coin or look up its size (Wikipedia, search engine, &c.)
* Put in the diameter and thickness in `B6` and `B7`. Make sure to keep the `=` and `mm`.
* Check that you have enough coins. The spreadsheet shows the number needed. Typically 12, 9 for thicker coins like 10 euro cent and up.
* Change other values in the “B” column, to taste.
* Go back to the `yaccs_3_arm` view
* Check that the shown shape looks OK. There are view controls at the top
* Check that in the tree view there are no exclamation marks as warnings
* If there *are* problems, it’s easiest to close *without* saving and to try again. Change fewer values, and only by small amounts.
* If the spinner looks good, select the last item, “spinner”. It should turn green in the main view.
* Look for the dropdown in the tool bar and select “Mesh Design”
* You should now have a “Meshes” menu. Select “Create mesh from shape …”
* I have to select the “Standard” radio button. “Mefisto” produces empty meshes.
* Click OK
* There should be a “spinner (Meshed)” item in the tree view. Select it.
* Click on the “Export a mesh to file” icon, enter a file name, select the file type (STL or OBJ) and click “OK”,
* Et voilà, you’re done. You have finished your first FreeCAD lesson and can now go ahead and slice and print your customized spinner.

The FreeCAD version is for the more compact (thin walled) version.

There is also some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/yacs).

All my “yacs” spinners are related and started out with the same bearing ring.
