iFAQ

Q: Is this a joke?
A: Yes. The question is on whom.

Q: I knew it wasn’t a bottle opener.
A: That’s not a question.

Q: So this is no bottle opener?
A: No, i use it to open bottles all the time.

Q: How?
A: GIYF (tounge emoji) One hint: you have to use two hands. If you need a one-handed bottle opener, try [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480178) or its parent.

Q: And what’s the joke, then?
A: It’s that you can open a beer bottle with any object that’s roughly the right size, and that’s stable enough, and either so hard that the bottle cap leaves no marks, or so cheap that you don’t mind the marks.
