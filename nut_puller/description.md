A tool to remove hex nuts that have been glued in place or are otherwise a little stuck.
Print this, place it over the nut and pull it out by screwing in a bolt. Use a washer between the bolt and the thing. If a plastic thing like this isn’t strong enough, maybe you need some other solution. If you are using non-metric nuts and bolts, you should re-examine that decisions, or, alternatively, what has led to your country using a mixed-up system of measurements.

## Print settings

doesn’t matter

## How

The resulting thing is quite simple, but i still put a CC-© on this because the size selection code in the `scad` file isn’t as trivial.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/nut_puller).
