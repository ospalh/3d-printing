This is an arm to mount a Raspberry Pi camera to an 8 mm (acrylic) print bed. I use it on my GeeTech i3 pro C, but it should fit lots of other models as well.
Although it is a bit loose, and i had to fix it sticky tape.

This works great with OctoPrint (and OctoPi). It gives great time lapses with the printed object stable when you have a moving print bed.

Combine this with the upper parts of Daniel Bull’s Raspberry Pi [camera mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:239268). The mount is not included because of incompatible licenses.
