A cleat to stop tea bag strings from falling into the tea. How securely you tie the string to this is up to you.

This should be adapted to specific mugs. Set the mug’s diameter and wall width in the customizer. It works well only with cylindrical mugs, not with tea cups with more complicated shapes.

### How to print

This should be printed with falsework. Shocking, i know.




## how desigend

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Teebeutelklampe).


### Food and 3D printing

* In some ways PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that. Or maybe PETG
* On the other hand, aceton smoothed ABS has fewer ridges for germs to reside in, so maybe do that instead
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.
* On the other hand, you should fill up your cup to just *below* this, and so there shouldn’t be too much of a problem.


These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.


## Vocabulary rant

***[falsework](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/falsework)***: a temporary frame serving to support and brace a building under construction until it can stand alone.

In other word, those structures that you sometimes need when printing overhangs.My guess is that the first people that wrote a slicer just didn’t know that word, maybe even the large scale construction *concept*, and reinvented the wheel and named it the “circular transportation facilitation device”. Or “supports”. I try my best to use the correct word, falsework, when possible.
