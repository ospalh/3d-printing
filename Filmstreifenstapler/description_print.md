Stack (freshly scanned) photos.

This is a variant of my film strip stacker in sizes large enough to stack photos (prints).

It is just as much a quick hack as the film scanner. Just don’t break of the side plates.

There are meshes for different sizes ready:

* 8 cm × 12 cm
* 9 cm × 13 cm
* 10 cm × 15 cm

If you need other sizes, you should use OpenSCAD on your own computer. This was a quick hack, and i CBA to make this work with the customizer.

Unfortunately i forgot to take pictures of these before i finished scanning my photos and then binned these things.


## how to print

300 µm

Easy print. Use big layer hights to speed up the print.


## how

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).

¹“small picture”, because they are smaller than medium format, get it‽ And medium format is smaller than full sized sheet film, which starts at something like 13 cm × 18 cm, i think
