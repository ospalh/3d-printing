Stack (freshly scanned) film strips.

This is a thing i quickly whipped up while digitizing thousands of old negative strips. This keeps them needly stacked untill i store them away again.

This thing doesn’t use  fillets, so yes, you can break off the side plates, if you want to. Just don’t do it. Feel free to design something more stable and sophisticated if you need it. And yes, the lids are just a cuboids. They work fine.

You should probably do something to keep this from scratching the first and last strip. Maybe stick already spoiled strips or just pieces of paper onto those thing. Or use aceton smoothing. I ended up doing both, for different sizes.

As always, use things at your own risk. Don’t use it with too precious films. (The strips in the photo are mostly pictures of of long gone day trips nobody cares about.)

There is a bunch of versions, for different film sizes and strip length.

* 135 film (called »Kleinbild« in German) six picture strips as you got in the 1960s. This one was too big for my printer and you have to glue the left and right parts together.
* 135 film six picture strips stacker in one piece. (Or two, if you count the lid.) You can use it when you have a big priter.
* 135 film *five* picture strips (1970s)
* 135 film four picture strips as they are common nowadays. Well, when people still used silver based films. I have lots and lots of films of this size, and so this holder is higher than the other.
* 126 or large Instamatic film, four picture strips.
* 110 or Pocket Instamatic film, five picture strips. This one has feet or plates to keep it from falling over
* Minox 9.2 mm “spy camera” strips for roughly eleven pictures, with feet, too.

Of course you can use one holder for the different 35 mm film strips, but using the right sizes gives you neater stacks.

Oh, and »Sechser-«, »Fünfer-« and »Vierer-« mean “for six”, “for five” and “for four”, if you don’t read German.


There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).
