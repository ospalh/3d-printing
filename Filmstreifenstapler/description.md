Stack (freshly scanned) 135 or Minox film strips.

This is a thing i quickly whipped up while digitizing thousands of old negative strips. This keeps them needly stacked untill i store them away again.

This thing doesn’t use  fillets, so yes, you can break off the side plates, if you want to. Just don’t do it. Feel free to design something more stable and sophisticated if you need it. And yes, the lids are just a cuboids. They work fine.

You should probably do something to keep this from scratching the first and last strip. Maybe stick already spoiled strips onto those thing. Or use aceton smoothing. I ended up doing both, one for each sizes.

As always, use things at your own risk. Don’t use it with too precious films. (The strips in the photo are mostly pictures of of long gone day trips nobody cares about.)

There are two versions. One for 35 mm film, the standard four negative 135 strip, and one for 9.2 mm Minox “spy camera” strips.


There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).
