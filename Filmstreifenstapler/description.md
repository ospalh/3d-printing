Stack (freshly scanned) film strips.

This is a bunch of things i quickly whipped up while digitizing thousands of old negative strips. This kept them neatly stacked untill i stored them away again.

This thing doesn’t use  fillets, so yes, you can break off the side plates, if you want to. Just don’t do it. Feel free to design something more stable and sophisticated if you need it. And yes, the lids are just a cuboids. They work fine.

There is a bunch of versions, for different film sizes and strip length.

* 120 (60 mm medium format) for 20 cm strips. This one was too big for my printer and you have to glue the left and right parts together. Not pictured
* 135 film (called »Kleinbild«¹ in German) six picture strips as you got in the 1960s. Left and right, too.
* 135 film six picture strips stacker in one piece. (Or two, if you count the lid.) You can use it when you have a big priter.
* 135 film *five* picture strips (1970s)
* 135 film four picture strips as they are common nowadays. Well, when people still used silver based films. I have lots and lots of films of this size, and so this holder is higher than the other.
* 126 or large Instamatic film, four picture strips.
* 110 or Pocket Instamatic film, five picture strips. This one has feet or plates to keep it from falling over
* Minox 9.2 mm spy camera strips for roughly eleven pictures, with feet, too.

You can also change the size in the customizer, although i think i covered most common formats.

»Sechser-«, »Fünfer-« and »Vierer-« in the `STL` file names  is German for  “for six”, “for five” and “for four”.


## how to print

300 µm

Easy print. Use big layer heights to speed up the print.


## post printing

It’s best to put some old newspaper or similar at the bottom of the stacker and on the lid (if you use that), to avoid scratching you film strips.

## how

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).

¹“small picture”, because they are smaller than medium format, get it‽ And medium format is smaller than full sized sheet film, which starts at something like 13 cm × 18 cm, i think
