Stack (freshly scanned) 135 film strips.

This is a thing i quickly whipped up while digitizing thousands of old negative strips. This keeps them needly stacked untill i store them away again.

This thing doesn’t use  fillets, so yes, you can break off the side plates, if you want to. Just don’t do it. Feel free to design something more stable and sophisticated if you need it. And yes, the lid is just a cuboid. Works fine.

You should probably do something to keep this from scratching the first and last strip. Maybe stick already spoiled strips onto those thing.

As always, use things at your own risk. This may still scratch up your film. Use caution, and don’t use it with too precious films. (The strips in the photo are mostly of long gone day trips nobody cares about and, to be honest, quite boring.)

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).
