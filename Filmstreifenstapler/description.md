Stack (freshly scanned) 135 film strips.

This is a thing i quickly whipped up while digitizing thousands of old negative strips. This keeps them needly stacked untill i store them away again.

This thing doesn’t use  fillets, so yes, you can break off the side plates, if you want to. Just don’t do it. Feel free to design something more stable and sophisticated if you need it.

You should probably do something to keep this from scratching the first and last strip. Maybe stick one already spoiled strip each onto those thing. Just get the emulsion wet and it should stick.

As always, use things at your own risk. This may still scratch up your film. Use caution, or don’t use it with your precious films.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Filmstreifenstapler).
