Yet another draughts piece. This one should work nicely with 42 mm squares on the board.

It has an annular design, that is, a hole in the middle. It also has a recess for a one eurocent coin to mark promoted pieces.


## Print settings

whatever use infill for weight

## How

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Damestein).

The diameter is 30 mm, for other sizes use OpenSCAD and create your own verison.
