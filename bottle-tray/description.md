Tightly packed bottle tray

A customizable bottle tray with the bottles tightly packed. I use this in my fridge. The syrup bottle i keep their always fell over, and are neatly kept in place now with this thing.

This is loosely based on [Ian Pegg](https://www.thingiverse.com/deckingman/about)’s [bottle tray](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1345795), and uses [Tomas Ebringer](https://www.thingiverse.com/Shii/about)’s [idea](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1751410) to add holes.

The main difference is that this arranges the bottles on a hexagonal grid. So the holes between the bottles are smaller. The wall directly between the bottles is made as thin as possible, just barely separating the bottles. You can also give the tray a honeycomb look, using hexagonal instead of circular cross sections.
