A wedge to hold a glass at a 45° angle, so you can get a wedge of ice in there.

The size of the glass, the angle and the sturdiness of the thing can be changed in the customizer. When it’s not working, you can get a development snapshot of OpenSCAD, and use that programme’s customizer. See Alexander Thomas’ [instructions](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2812634)


### Print Settings

* Supports: no
* Raft: no
* 5 %
* 300 µm

I used many (5) perimeters and many (6) top layers. Like that, a low infill of 5 % works well.

I also used a brim, to avoid warping.

The layer height of 300 µm works OK. You get steps on the top surface, but that’s fine.

This should be an easy print. No falsework or similar required.

### how

I liked matt sauter’s “[Whiskey Wedge - Angled Ice](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2784800)”, but that needs to be printed with falsework. (He used the more common term “supports”.) So, i used the general idea as inspiration and made my own version in OpenSCAD. I thought matt’s version was too solid, so i cut a big hole into the middle of mine. Look at the `.scad` file for the actual “how” of the design.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/tumbler-wedge).
