A somewhat simple stopper (bung, cork, plug, stopple &c.) for bottles and the like.
Set it to the size you need.

This as two extra options apart from the standard circular plug:
* With a notch that fits a string or rubber band to hold the plug in place
* Scaling the plug in one direction to get an elliptical shape


The filleting at the edge between flange and stopper proper makes the definition of the diameter a bit ambiguous. Maybe you want to do a test print of just the bit above and below the fillet and adjust the size.


Use Filaflex, Ninjaflex or similar.

Apart from the material, this should be an easy print. No falsework or similar required. Use enough top layers and perimeters to get this watertight.
