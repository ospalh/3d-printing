This is a slightly modified version of the [Money Spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1937473) by GeoffB. I had a lot of 20 euro cent coins lying around, and wanted to use those. This is a good way to put some copper coins you have lying around since your last trip to good use.

Instead of selecting from a short list of coins, now you have to put in the size of your favourite coin directly. Look it up at Wikipedia, do a web search, or use a calliper. The pre-set size is for 20 euro cent coins. For the centre, you have to use a 608-sized bearing, i.e. 8 mm × 22 mm × 7 mm.

When you use euro coins, you can make yours a symbol of international cooperation. Mine is using coins from


* France
* Greece
* Ireland
* Italy
* Portugal
* Slovenia
* Austria
* Germany
* the Netherlands

Nine coins, nine countries! The last three are on the inside.

I also added the bearing caps from Arondite’s [Fidget Toy Comfort Spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1816684)

You may have to adjust your scale slightly to make the bearing and coins fit, especially if your printer is not calibrated too precisely. I had to use 101 %.

Included are three variants of the spinner as STLs:

* One with three spokes for three 20 Euro cent coins. This is the one i have printed.
* Then i wanted it BIG. That can’t be made with the customizer, as the coin stacks are higher than the bearing. For that you should use 28 20 Euro cent coins, in seven spokes à four coins.
* The last one is for Chinese 1 jiao renminbi coins, 3 spokes à 4 mao.
