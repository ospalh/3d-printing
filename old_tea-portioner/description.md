Quickly measure the right amount of tea leaves for one pot, or other granular materials where you need the same amount every day:

* Place the funnel on the measuring cup. There *is* a right way, with the wider brim of the funnel on the flat surface of the cup, but with the funnel in another direction it should work well, too.
* Pour in the tea leaves until the cup is a bit over full.
* Slide off the funnel, striking the measuring cup and pouring the extra tea back in its tin over the chute.
* The measure now contains the right amount of tea. Pour it into the filter or teapot. I use my [funnel and stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2144990) for this.


The STL files included are for 44 cm³ (44 ml) and 55 cm³ (55 ml), the
right amount of rooibos tea for my two teapots, 1 dm³ (1 l) and 1.25
dm³ (1.25 l). For other sizes use the customizer.  When you have a mass, look up the density in the [FAO list](http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf), elsewhere, or measure yourself.

The “American customary units” in the customizer *is* a bit of a joke, or my pet peeve.
Practically, Americans should look up the millilitres per teaspoon &c. in [this list](http://www.jsward.com/cooking/conversion.shtml), and visit [metric4us](http://metric4us.com/) at their leisure after they printed their portioner.

Of course there’s nothing wrong with using measuring spoons or scoops like things [682146](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:682146) or [619626](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:619626). Except that the designer seems to think that 29.5735295625 cm³ or 14.7867647825 cm³ are useful units of measurement, and won’t [discourage](http://metric4us.com) Americans – and Britons – from that silly habit. I still prefer this thing because tilting a tea tin is easier than filling a measuring spoon, especially if their is barely enough tea in the tin for one pot.


### Print Settings

* Supports: no
* Raft: maybe
* Brim: yes Measuring cup only. The chute may fall over without it.
* Make sure the chute is to the left or right on Mendel (Průša) style printers, or the y axis acceleration force would work to tear it loose.



### Safety concerns

* PLA seems to be better suited for food use than ABS, so you should use that. Or maybe PETG
* You should probably clean your nozzle once, to get rid of mineral oil and other residues.
* When you use an oiler, use a suitable oil. Maybe a vegetable oil or something like Ballistol oil.
* The food comes into contact with the printed parts for only a short time, and it is usually dry, so it should hardly be effected at all.

These two articles shed some more light on the issue:
* [10 things you need to know about 3D printing & food safety](https://pinshape.com/blog/3d-printing-food-safe/)
* [Food Safe Video](https://joes3dworkbench.blogspot.de/2015/07/food-safe-video.html)

In the end, it is up to you. I can take no responsibility.
