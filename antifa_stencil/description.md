A stencil to decorate your milkshakes with the two flag
symbol of the Antifaschistische Aktion.

Does the pattern transfer like the print of a rubber stamp when you throw the milkshake cocoa first? I think some experiments should be done to find out.

The symbol was taken from [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antifalogo.svg)
