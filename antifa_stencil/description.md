A stencil to decorate your milkshakes with the two flag
symbol of the Antifaschistische Aktion.

Does the pattern transfer like the print of a rubber stamp when you throw the milkshake cocoa first? I think some experiments should be done to find out.

You probably could use this with a laser cutter. I have added an SVG, but donâ€™t know how well that will work out.

The symbol was taken from [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antifalogo.svg)

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/antifa_stencil).
