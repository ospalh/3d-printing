A Japanese style seal to be used as mitome-in (認印) or a less formal hanko (判子). (I would not use this design as a bank seal.)

This could in principle be used with the site’s customizer, but for two points:
* There is no Japanese font easily available
* At the moment only strict ASCII files work with the customizer, which is even more counter productive when you want to use kanji/hanzi then for more western things.


You need:
* A development snapshot version of [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) with the build in customizer
* A nice font
* Maybe somebody to help you with writing your name in Chinese or Japanese¹²
* to forget about the “Chinese” fonts some crappy tattoo artists use.²

You can do the text in one, two or three lines. When you have a two or three character name you can use the lines to simulate vertical writing. For Latin characters i would recommend using one line of horizontal text.
With the “Tweak” sliders you can change the size and shape of the text to make it fit into the confines of the seal.

There are two styles for the seal, one is to print the whole seal and grip as one thing, or to split the seal and the grip in two, print the seal with a somewhat soft material such as flexible PLA and the grip with standard PLA and glue them together.

The cap, ink pad and ink pad cap should be self explanatory. I would print the ink pad cap with a soft material, too.
The foam punch can be used to make the right sized ink pad sponge out of some foam or cloth. When it’s not strong enough to actually punch out the shape it can still be used to mark the right size.

The grooves in the shapes are for keeping the caps on with rubber bands. The sphere on the grip marks the left side of the seal.

As these are meant to be individualized i will not upload any meshes (`STL` files). Do get OpenSCAD and make your own version.

## How to print

These are mostly easy print. Use PLA or other standard material and standard print settings for most parts.

Use a flexible material such as NinjaFlex or Filaflex for the ink pad cap. Use flexible PLA for the rubber seal, if you use that instead of the one part seal.

## How designed

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/mitome-in).
