A minimalist frame to hang a Raspberry Pi from a single 3 mm screw. Fits models B+, Pi 2 and Pi 3.

I used the “offset” stl to hang my OctoPi that is controlling the printer on the frame of my GeeTech i3 pro C. That had an almost convenient screw hole above the printer controller board. Only, it is too close to the wall (X-Z frame). With the mounting screw set off by 20 mm, it fits nicely. A hanger rather than a case is also nicely in line with the DIY kit look of the printer.

The Pi PCB is simply clipped onto the frame. It works well enough, my Pi hasn’t fallen of yet.

The offset and most other sizes can be somewhat easily changed in the scad file.The plastic posts to clip on the Pi can be replaced with screw holes for a more secure fit, if desired. I found the 2 mm arm size strong enough, but put in a sturdier version anyway.

This is an easy, quick print. No falsework (commonly called “supports”) rafts or brims necessary. Print settings don’t matter much. PLA works fine.
