Yet another traffic cone.

The point of this is that most of the weight is in the base, and the actual cone part is rather thin. You can tip this something like 70° and it will right itself. It’s basically impossible to blow this one over, at leas on a flat surface.
The mesh is for a 50 mm high version. 1:10 scale for a standard European small (50 cm night-and-day) cone.

Designed for 0.4 mm nozzles.


## How to print

* 200 µm
* 70 %



Don’t just rescale this for other sizes. Use the customizer or OpenSCAD.

Use high infill simply to get enough mass at the bottom. With 80 % infill it ended up weighing 3.3 g, slightly too heavy. The standard says the original should be ≥ 2.5 kg. (1:10 scale means 1:1000 volume, and  1 g in the model := 1 kg for life size.)

This is desigend with filament change in mind. When you use OpenSCAD this prints out the heights for the filament change to get two white rings. For the 50 mm version these are

* red→white at 13.2 mm
* white→red at 22.4 mm
* red→white at 31.6 mm
* white→red at 40.8 mm


## how designed

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Leitkegel).
