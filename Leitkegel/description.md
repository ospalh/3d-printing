Yet another traffic cone.

The point of this is that most of the weight is in the base, and the actual cone part is rather thin. Hard to tip over, as it should be.
The mesh is for a 50 mm high version. 1:10 scale for a standard European small (50 cm) cone. ()

Designed for 0.4 mm nozzles.


## How to print

Don’t just rescale this for other sizes. Use the customizer or OpenSCAD.

This is desigend with filament change in mind. When you use OpenSCAD this prints out the heights for the filament chgange to get two white rings. For the 50 mm version these are

* red→white at 13.2 mm
* white→red at 22.4 mm
* red→white at 31.6 mm
* white→red at 40.8 mm


## how designed

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/Leitkegel).
