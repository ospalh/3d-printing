A simple arrow shape.

I needed a little reminder which side the of a thing¹ was “up” and couldn’t find a nice, simple arrow, so here’s one.

This might not even qualify for copyiright in Germany, so, have fun.

# How designed

This is just text, the “⇫” (“upwards white arrow on pedestal”) character in the [Symbola](https://fontlibrary.org/de/font/symbola), the font of choice if you want some odd arrow, other rare symbol, or just hassle free print friendly monochrome emoji.


¹The film strips i am scanning have notches that switch between being at the top and bottom of the negatives. I have this lying beside my scanner pointing in the appropriate direction.
