Yu don’t really need to wash up the spoon yu use to scoop the coffee out of its tin every time. But where to stow it between uses? Something where it’s upright, bowl up, would be nice. Maybe with some little dish to catch the few grains of coffee powder falling off it.

So, here, my spoon stand. Measure the size of yur spoon and set it in the customizer.

## how

This is based on my [small parts dish](). Actually, i first designt  this, and later deleted the stand bit to get only the dish, and published that one first.

There is some design history available at my [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/spoon_holder).
