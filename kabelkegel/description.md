Ferrite bead anti pull out cone

A cone to put on a cable, close to a ferrite bead. This is to keep the bead from catching on a table edge and pulling out the cable with it. I use it on a scanner, that sits on the back edge of my desk most of the time, that i pull to the front edge when i want to use it.

The connecting mechanism doesn’t really work, and i had to fix the two halves with stick tape. Does it job, so i won’t work out a perfect vitamin free solution.
