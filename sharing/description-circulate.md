A rubber stamp to tel people to “Keep circulating the books”.

I donate book that i’v read to the public bookcase near my house, but i don’t want these books to show up as merchandize of a for-profit second hand book seller.¹ Books i put into that bookcase are to be free!

So, to deter people from selling these, or rather from paying for them, i stamp my used books with this.²

## how to print:

The actual “rubber” part should be done with soft, flexible material, at least fPLA. Use filament change. Go from the flexible material to standard PLA at 2 mm.

## how designt

This was done with OpenScad. One trick i used was `hull()`, to get the plate and spars with exactly the size and shape of the text.

I have made two more stamps, that you can get from [github repo](https://github.com/ospalh/3d-printing/tree/develop/sharing). There is some design history available there, too.

I use “Simplified Spelling Boaad”/“Handbook of Simplified Spelling” rules.

¹I hav no idea how common this is, or if it happens at all.
²I hav no idea how effective this is, either.
